# Deploying Windows Server 2022 and Linux Servers in AWS

This project involves the deployment of Windows Server 2022 and Linux servers in AWS. The servers will serve as the basis for future projects. The deliverables include a Word document with installation screenshots and saved command outputs. The Windows server must meet specific requirements, including being fully patched with Windows Updates, while the Linux server must also be fully patched. 

## Project Steps
1. The first step of the project involved deploying Windows Server 2022 and Linux servers in AWS. This was done using the AWS Academy Learner Lab. 
2. After deploying the servers, the next step was to ensure that they were fully patched. This was done by running Windows Updates for the Windows server and updating the Linux server as well. 
3. Throughout the installation process, I took screenshots to document the steps. This was particularly important for the Windows Server installation, where I had to capture the “Last installed updates” date from the Server Manager. 
4. In addition to taking screenshots, I also saved the output from various commands. This was particularly important when setting a static IP address for the Windows Server.

## Challenges and Learnings
- Understanding the AWS environment and deploying the servers was initially challenging, but with some practice, I was able to get the hang of it.
- Ensuring that the servers were fully patched was a meticulous task that required attention to detail.
- Taking screenshots and saving command outputs helped me understand the process better and served as a good reference for future projects.

## Conclusion

This project was a great learning experience. It provided hands-on experience with AWS and server deployment, and it helped solidify my understanding of these concepts. I look forward to applying these skills in future projects.

## Future Work
In the future, I plan to explore more AWS services and apply the knowledge gained from this project to real-world applications. I also plan to improve my understanding of auto scaling and load balancing as these are crucial for building scalable and highly available applications.
